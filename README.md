## Overview 
This group project showcases our skills in CSS/SASS/Bootstrap. Beyond improving our technical skills, it has provided a platform for us to work cohesively as a team, refine our soft skills, and seamlessly collaborate using GitHub. 
We decided to create a website for a beautiful retreat place in Sri Lanka, inspired by our shared love for nature and stunning images of the country.  

## Features
- Dynamic text animation
- Specific styles for sections like .booking, .banner, .our-package, and .services.
- Service sections feature background images with gradient overlays.
- Image with a subtle scaling and translational animation (@keyframes).
- Media queries ensure responsiveness for diverse screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience.
- Carousel styling includes indicators, captions, and responsive adjustments for a seamless user experience.

These CSS features collaboratively contribute to a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly design for the Sunrise Retreat website.
